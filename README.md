# Erine's dotfiles

This is collection of dotfiles made with Stow.

## Usage

To use this dotfiles repo with Stow, clone this repo to your $HOME directory, then use Stow to create symlinks to the $HOME/.config/ directory. I do suggest backing up your configurations before doing this tho.

```
git clone https://github.com/thr3nody/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
stow .
```
